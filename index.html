    <h1>Welcome to Matvey Polin's various scripting projects</h1>

    <p>These userscripts are best installed by <a href="https://tampermonkey.net">Tampermonkey</a> for Chrome.</p>
    <p><b>First</b>, a userscript to download CSV files of roll call votes from both the House and Senate
    websites. This is helpful if you're trying to download a just recently published congressional
    roll call vote that has not yet been published on <a href="https://voteview.com">Voteview</a> or
    <a href="https://govtrack.us">Govtrack</a>. <a href="https://github.com/mlinlin/mlinlin.github.io/blob/master/RollCallCSV.user.js">Link to userscript</a>.</p>

    <p><b>Second</b>, a userscript to see likes and dislikes of YouTube videos shown in the sidebar of the 
    YouTube website. <a href="https://github.com/mlinlin/mlinlin.github.io/blob/master/YouTubeLikes.user.js">Link to userscript.</a></p>

    <p><b>Third</b>, a userscript to display voting records for Senators and Representatives. Each time a
    page for a recorded vote on the House or Senate websites loads, all voting records for a year 
    are downloaded from the congressional websites. This information is then used to 
    calculate each Senator's or Representative's votes with the other party (absolute bipartisanship),
    as well as whether their absolute bipartisanship is greater or less than average for members of their
    own party (relative bipartisanship) for the year. The latter is generally more useful for ranking due to many congressional
    votes being near unanimous. Their votes are then displayed in order of their relative bipartisanship as
    squares, with the top leftmost having the most strongly anti-Republican voting records and the bottom rightmost having the most strongly anti-Democratic ones. Dark red and dark blue squares are Nays/Nos, ordinary
    colored blue and red squares are Yays/Ayes, the lightest colors are Not Voting, and those colored in a tone
    between ordinary colored blue and red and the lightest colors are Present. Mousing over a politician will result
    in an orange box popping up to display their name, state, party, vote, and absolute and relative bipartisanship
    for the year the vote occured in. Clicking on a politician will result in his vote being highlighted in black. 
    I have made sure the script works with tablets as well as with mice. As with the first script, very useful if one is trying to see a voting record before it is published on Voteview or Govtrack, and has a much better means for users to select specific legislators. The Voteview site also incorrectly counts Present votes as Absent legislators in the web version of the site, which is not a flaw of my script. My means of measuring bipartisanship is also superior to Govtrack's sponsorship-based one of predicting voting records. Best of all, all information displayed via the script comes directly from the congressional sites, so there is much less room for error in the data.
