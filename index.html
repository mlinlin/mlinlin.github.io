    <p>First, a userscript to download CSV files of roll calls from both the House and Senate

    roll call vote that has not yet been published on Voteview.</p>
    <p>Second, a userscript to see likes and dislikes on YouTube videos shown in the sidebar of the 
    YouTube website</p>
    <p>Third, the flag of the European Union, with stars positioned and resized according to the
