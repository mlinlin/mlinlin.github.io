    <h1>Hello, and welcome to my various scripting projects</h1>
    <p>First, a userscript to download CSV files of roll calls from both the House and Senate
    websites. This is helpful if you're trying to download a just recently published congressional
    roll call vote that has not yet been published on Voteview.</p>

    <p>Second, a userscript to see likes and dislikes on YouTube videos shown in the sidebar of the 
    YouTube website</p>

    <p>Third, a userscript to display voting records for Senators and Representatives. Each time a
    page for a recorded vote on the House or Senate websites loads, all voting records for a year 
    are downloaded from the congressional websites. This information is then used to 
    calculate each Senator's or Representative's votes with the other party (absolute bipartisanship),
    as well as whether their absolute bipartisanship is greater or less than average for members of their
    own party (relative bipartisanship). Their vote is then displayed in order of their bipartisanship as
    squares, from left to right and from top down. Dark red and dark blue squares are Nays/Nos, ordinary
    colored blue and red squares are Yays/Ayes, the lightest colors are Not Voting, and those colored in a tone
    between ordinary colored blue and red and the lightest colors are Present. Mousing over a politician will result
    in an orange box popping up to display their name, state, party, vote, and absolute and relative bipartisanship
    for the year the vote occured in. I have made sure the script works with tablets as well as with mice.</p>
